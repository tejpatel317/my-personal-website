        <h1>Simple Interest Calculator</h1>
            <p>The formula for simple interest is straightforward since it does not include the effect of compounding. In other others, the interest rate will only be applied to the principal amount.</p>
            <p>Total Amount = P + (P x R x T)</p>
            <p>P = Principal amount in dollars</p>
                <input placeholder="Enter the principal amount" id="simplePrincipal">
            <p>R = Anual rate of interest</p>
                <input placeholder="Enter the interest rate per year" id="simpleInterest">
            <p>T = Number of terms in years</p> 
                <input placeholder="Enter the number of years" id="simpleTerm">

        <h1>Compound Interest Calculator</h1>
            <p>Compound interest is the interest on interest. This means that the interest is not only applied to the principal amount, but also the accumulated interest over time.</p>
            <p>Total Amount = P(1+R/N)NT</p>
            <p>P = Principal amount in dollars</p>
                <input placeholder="Enter the principal amount" id="compoundPrincipal">
            <p>R = Annual rate of interest</p>
                <input placeholder="Enter the interest rate per year" id="compoundInterest">
            <p>T = Number of terms in years</p> 
                <input placeholder="Enter the number of years" id="compoundTerm">
            <p>N = How many times interest is compounded per year</p> 
                <input placeholder="Enter the number of years" id="compoundN">
